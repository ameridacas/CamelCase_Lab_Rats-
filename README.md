## Description
We had created this application to give users a way to find out the popularity of a movie of their choice via the amount of times the wikipedia page for that specified movie was viewed by a human. Also in this application the user will be able to view the movie's Popularity, Release Date, Box Office, Run Time, Genre, and display the Movie's Poster. One thing this application helped us learn the nuances of the Fetch Function.
